# Privacy Policy

Last updated: October 4, 2024

This Privacy Policy describes how Dynamic Delivery Date (the "App", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your personal information when you use the App on your Shopify store (the "Services"). For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "you" and "your" means you as the user of the Services, whether you are a customer or another individual whose information we have collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, including to reflect changes to our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will post the revised Privacy Policy on the App, update the "Last updated" date and take any other steps required by applicable law.

### What Personal Information We Collect

The types of personal information we obtain about you depends on how you interact with our App and use our Services. When we use the term "personal information", we are referring to information that identifies, relates to, describes or can be associated with you. The following sections describe the categories and specific types of personal information we collect.

### Information We Collect Directly from You

Information that you directly submit to us through our Services may include:

- **Contact details** including your name, email, and Shopify store url.
- **Customer support** information including the information you choose to include in communications with us, for example, when sending a message through the Services.

Some features of the Services may require you to directly provide us with certain information about yourself. You may elect not to provide this information, but doing so may prevent you from using or accessing these features.

We do **not** collect personal information from your customers.

### Information We Obtain from Third Parties

Finally, we may obtain information about you from third parties, including from vendors and service providers who may collect information on our behalf, such as:

- Companies who support our App and Services, such as Shopify.
- When you use our App, open or click on emails we send you, or interact with our Services or advertisements, we, or third parties we work with, may automatically collect certain information using online tracking technologies such as pixels, web beacons, software developer kits, third-party libraries, and cookies.

Any information we obtain from third parties will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Also see the section below, Third Party Websites and Links.

### How We Use Your Personal Information

- **Providing Products and Services.** We use your personal information to provide you with the Services in order to perform our contract with you, including to send notifications to you related to your subscription, discounts, refunds or other transactions, to create, maintain and otherwise manage your usage of the Services, to arrange for features and functionalities related to your usage of the Services.
- **Communicating with You and Service Improvement.** We use your personal information to provide you with customer support and improve our Services. This is in our legitimate interests in order to be responsive to you, to provide effective services to you, and to maintain our business relationship with you according to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.

## Third Party Websites and Links

Our App may provide links to websites or other online platforms operated by third parties. If you follow links to sites not affiliated or controlled by us, you should review their privacy and security policies and other terms and conditions. We do not guarantee and are not responsible for the privacy or security of such sites, including the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of information found on these sites. Information you provide on public or semi-public venues, including information you share on third-party social networking platforms may also be viewable by other users of the Services and/or users of those third-party platforms without limitation as to its use by us or by a third party. Our inclusion of such links does not, by itself, imply any endorsement of the content on such platforms or of their owners or operators, except as disclosed on the Services.

## Security and Retention of Your Information

Please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee “perfect security.” In addition, any information you send to us may not be secure while in transit. We recommend that you do not use insecure channels to communicate sensitive or confidential information to us.

How long we retain your personal information depends on different factors, such as whether we need the information to maintain your account, to provide the Services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes or enforce other applicable contracts and policies.

## Your Rights

Depending on where you live, you may have some or all of the rights listed below in relation to your personal information. However, these rights are not absolute, may apply only in certain circumstances and, in certain cases, we may decline your request as permitted by law.

Please note that if you visit our App with the Global Privacy Control opt-out preference signal enabled, depending on where you are, we will automatically treat this as a request to opt-out of the "sale" or "sharing" of information for the device and browser that you use to visit the App.
- **Restriction of Processing**: You may have the right to ask us to stop or restrict our processing of personal information.
  Withdrawal of Consent: Where we rely on consent to process your personal information, you may have the right to withdraw this consent.

- **Managing Communication Preferences**: We may send you promotional emails, and you may opt out of receiving these at any time by using the unsubscribe option displayed in our emails to you. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as those about your account or orders that you have made.

You may exercise any of these rights where indicated on our App or by contacting us using the contact details provided below.

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights. We may need to collect information from you to verify your identity, such as your email address or account information, before providing a substantive response to the request. In accordance with applicable laws, you may designate an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require that the agent provide proof you have authorized them to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us. We will respond to your request in a timely manner as required under applicable law.
